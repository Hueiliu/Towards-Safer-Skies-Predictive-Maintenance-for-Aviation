Towards Safer Skies: Predictive Maintenance for Aviation
Overview
Unexpected part failures in aviation pose safety risks, disrupt operations, and lead to financial losses. Traditional maintenance strategies—such as scheduled servicing or reactive repairs—are costly and often ineffective.

This project leverages the National General Aviation Flight Information Database (NGAFID) to predict part failures using time-series flight sensor data. Our goal is to develop an explainable machine learning model that accurately classifies aircraft component health, enabling optimized maintenance schedules while providing clear insights into factors contributing to part degradation.
